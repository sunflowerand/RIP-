**********************RIPv1 Implementation***********************
********************Author: Gaurav Tungatkar*********************

Source Code Organization:
source files present in src directory

1)list.c implements a generic linked list which is used in routing table implementation

2)rip.c implements all key functionality of RIPv1- Includes 2 main modules
	a)input- called for input processing
	b)output- called for output processing

3)rip_simulation.c implements a simulation of RIPv1 by creating socket for RIP_PORT and calling input and output routines. Timer is spawned with callback as the output routine to generate periodic updates

4)mem.c implements memory management used in timer

5)timer.c implements timer routines

6)log.h defines logging functionality

7) executable takes 2 parametrs- neighbour file name & log file name

Neighbour file format-
xx.xx.xx.xx$yy.yy.yy.yy$

IP addrs of neighbour terminated by $

How To Build & Run:
	1)makefile in obj directory
	make
	2)To run
	./ripv1 neighbour log
